# Spherical Shell Problem ReadMe File

Describes the basic parameters of the spherical shell/point source problem.

## 1. Source Type
* Point source of neutrons
* Monoenergetic (14 MeV) particles
## 2. Materials
* Tungsten shell
* Void everywhere else
## 3. Geometry
* Thin spherical shell with r_in = 1000cm and r_out=1005cm)
* Neutron source located at origin (0,0,0)
## 4. Boundary Conditions
* Vacuum boundary condition to ensure particles do not enter void space at r>r_out
## 5. Tallies
* Elastic
* Absorption
* Flux
