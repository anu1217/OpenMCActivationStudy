1) Source
-Point source of neutrons
-Monoenergetic (14 MeV) particles

2) Materials
-Tungsten shell
-Void everywhere else

3) Geometry
-Thin spherical shell with r_in = 1000cm and r_out=1005cm)
-Neutron source located at origin (0,0,0)

4) Boundary conditions
-vacuum boundary condition to ensure particles do not enter void space at r>r_out

5) Tallies
-elastic scattering
-absorption
